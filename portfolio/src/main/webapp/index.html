          I have experience as a Software Engineering intern in Terragon

          I am a huge fan of musical theater and while I'm not much of a 
          singer, I consider myself a budding actress. I originated the 
          role of Yashira in the origianl play AI-Pollo by David Munnell.
          I also performed as #8 in RIT performing arts scholarship's 
          production of "The Wolves".
