                    My name is Oluwadolapo "Dolapo" Atobiloye. I am a second-year 
                    Bachelor's of Science student studying Computer Science at 
                    Rochester Insitute of Technology with a minor in Game Design 
                    & Development and an Immersion in Theater Arts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience as a Software Engineering intern in Terragon 
                    Group located in Lagos Nigeria. I have also completed multiple 
                    computer science and web design courses in my time at RIT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a huge fan of musical theater and while I'm not much of a 
                    singer, I consider myself a budding actress. I originated the 
                    role of Yashira in the origianl play AI-Pollo by David Munnell.
                    I also performed as #8 in RIT performing arts scholarship's 
                    production of "The Wolves". I try to abide by the motto "Live
                    while you can", which basically means try everything and is how 
                    I got into musicals in the first place.
