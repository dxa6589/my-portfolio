            <img id="me" src="./images/bitmoji.png">
            <p>
                My name is Oluwadolapo "Dolapo" Atobiloye. I am a second-year 
                Bachelor's of Science student studying Computer Science at 
                Rochester Insitute of Technology with a minor in Game Design 
                & Development and an Immersion in Theater Arts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience as a Software Engineering intern in Terragon 
                Group located in Lagos Nigeria. I have also completed multiple 
                computer science and web design courses in my time at RIT.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a huge fan of musical theater and while I'm not much of a 
                singer, I consider myself a budding actress. I originated the 
                role of Yashira in the origianl play AI-Pollo by David Munnell.
                I also performed as #8 in RIT performing arts scholarship's 
                production of "The Wolves". I try to abide by the motto "Live
                while you can", which basically means try everything and is how 
                I got into musicals in the first place.
